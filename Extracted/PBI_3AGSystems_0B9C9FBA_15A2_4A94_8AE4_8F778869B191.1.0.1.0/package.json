The chart produces decomposition of each element in the group section. The visualization is meant for showing Actual, Forecast, Planned, and Previous Year data across different categories (for example departments, regions, products etc.). Formatting for the charts is influenced by the International Business Communication Standards (IBCS). Customization options include resizing the data label font sizes, hiding data labels, adjusting the number of charts per row, adjusting currency (to thousands-K, Millions-M, Billions-B) and more. This visualization is ideal for comparing �Actual vs. Planned�, �Actual vs. Previous Year�, �Forecast vs. Planned�, and �Forecast vs. Previous Year�. Useful for displaying or monitoring grouped or time series data relative to a certain benchmark.","supportUrl":"https://3ag-survey.albertsbrain.com/TakeSurvey.aspx?SurveyID=m6KLl65","gitHubUrl":""},
