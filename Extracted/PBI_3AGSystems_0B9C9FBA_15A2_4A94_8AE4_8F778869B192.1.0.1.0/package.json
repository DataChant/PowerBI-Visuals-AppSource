The visualization is meant for comparing Actual, Forecast, Planned, and Previous Year data. The visualization formatting for the charts is influenced by the International Business Communication Standards (IBCS). By convention, it is recommended to use this chart with a time series variable on the x-axis. Customization available includes inversing the colours for red and green, resizing the data label font sizes, hiding data labels, adjusting units (to thousands-K, Millions-M, Billions-B) and more. This visualization is ideal for comparing �Actual vs. Planned�, �Actual vs. Previous Year�, �Forecast vs. Planned�, and �Forecast vs. Previous Year�.","supportUrl":"https://www.3agsystems.com/blog/column-chart-with-relative-variance","gitHubUrl":""},
