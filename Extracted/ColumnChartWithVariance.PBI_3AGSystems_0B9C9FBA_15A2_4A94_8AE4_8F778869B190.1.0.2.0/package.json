Customization available includes inversing the colours for red and green, resizing the data label font sizes, hiding data labels, adjusting units (to thousands-K, Millions-M, Billions-B) and more.This visualization is ideal for comparing �Actual vs. Planned�, �Actual vs. Previous Year�, �Forecast vs. Planned�, and �Forecast vs. Previous Year�.","supportUrl":"https://3ag-survey.albertsbrain.com/TakeSurvey.aspx?SurveyID=m6KLl65","gitHubUrl":""},
