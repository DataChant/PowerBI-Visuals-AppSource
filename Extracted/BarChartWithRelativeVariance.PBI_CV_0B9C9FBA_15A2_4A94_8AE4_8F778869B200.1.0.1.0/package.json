The visualization is meant for comparing Actual, Forecast, Planned, and Previous Year data. Formatting for the charts is influenced by the International Business Communication Standards (IBCS).  Customization available includes inversing the colours for red and green, resizing the data label font sizes, highlighting the data labels, hiding data labels, drill downs by category, adjusting units(to thousands-K, Millions-M, Billions-B) and more.  This visualization is ideal for comparing “Actual vs. Planned”, “Actual vs. Previous Year”, “Forecast vs. Planned”, and “Forecast vs. Previous Year”.","supportUrl":"www.3agsystems.com/blog/bar-chart-with-relative-variance","gitHubUrl":""},
