It can be calculated by looking at actual production for a time period (tons, units, etc.) or by measuring the �good� time that equipment is running. It can also be broken down into 3 components: Availability (comparison of equipment run-time vs. shift length), Performance (looks at what is produced versus what could have been produced), and Quality (the ratio of how much good, sellable product produced produce vs. total production).","supportUrl":"https://www.3agsystems.com/blog/oee-dashboard","gitHubUrl":""},
