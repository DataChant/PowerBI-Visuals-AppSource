        "description": "OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) measures how many good products an organization creates in a given timeframe divided by how many it theoretically could have produced if all machines and processes ran perfectly. It can be calculated by looking at actual production for a time period (tons, units, etc.) or by measuring the \ufffdgood\ufffd time that equipment is running. It can also be broken down into 3 components: Availability (comparison of equipment run-time vs. shift length), Performance (looks at what is produced versus what could have been produced), and Quality (the ratio of how much good, sellable product produced produce vs. total production).",
