It shows hierarchy through a series of concentric arcs/rings, where each arc corresponds to a level in the hierarchy. Each arc is segmented proportionally to represent its constituent details. It uses the radial layout to create an immersive visualization experience of the categorized dataset. The Sunburst chart is very effective to showcase how one ring is broken into its contributing pieces (i.e., sequential segments).","supportUrl":"https://powerviz.ai/contactus","gitHubUrl":""},
