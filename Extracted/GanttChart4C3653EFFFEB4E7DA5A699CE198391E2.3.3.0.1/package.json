On the left side of the chart is the Data Grid, which displays the activities or resources based on dimension members. On the right hand side the Gantt chart displays a visual representation of certain activities in the typical bar display. For example, you could visualize the Gantt Chart with one measure as Progress  and several additional dimensions indicating the actual and planned date values.A Gantt Chart as Resource Chart shows the timeline of the individual resource. A resource could be an actual person with an assigned task, or a resource could be an actual resource, such as a car or a machine, required for the task.
