It allows you to distinguish between common and special cause variation. It includes a mean and two process limits which are both used in the statistical interpretation of data. The rules: 1) Any single point  outside the process limits. 2) A run of 7 points above or below the mean (a  shift), or a run of 7 points all consecutively ascending or descending (a trend).    3) 2 out of 3 points within 1 sigam of the upper or lower control limit. All these rules are aids to interpretation but still require intelligent examination of the data. This visual highlights when a rule has been broken and highlights whether this is improvement or deterioration","supportUrl":"https://github.com/hayleyNEAS/SPC-Custom-Visual","gitHubUrl":"https://github.com/hayleyNEAS/SPC-Custom-Visual"},
