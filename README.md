# FAQ
## General questions

Q: What is the source of the files in this repository?

> A: The single source of truth for all of the Power BI Custom Visuals in this repository is [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps?product=power-bi-visuals). All the files in this repository are periodically imported using a Microsoft public API (which is available to Microsoft partners).

Q: Are the custom visuals here up to date?

> A: We periodically refresh this repository, and [announce](https://github.com/DataChant/PowerBI-Visuals-AppSource/discussions/categories/announcements) whatâ€™s new with Power BI visuals on AppSource by finding the difference between commits. For a specific visual - to ensure you get the latest visual, you can download it from [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps?product=power-bi-visuals) and compare the version with this repository. To have a bulk downloader automation with the current snapshot from AppSource (and not rely on this repository for periodical refreshes) you can download our Excel Macro-enabled file.

[Contact us](https://forms.office.com/r/xZMuiaSdYh?origin=lprLink) if you have any questions about the tool or need help in automating your exports of custom visuals from AppSource.

## Questions by Power BI developers
### I am a Power BI developer with a Power BI Pro license -

Q: What are the benefits of downloading the PBIVIZ files from this repository and not from Power BI Desktop or Microsoft AppSource?

> A: To get the latest version of a custom visual, we recommend that you download the visual directly from Microsoft. However, if you cannot access the visuals, need to get an older version or a visual that is no longer available in AppSource, you may find it in this repository. Note: If you choose to use the files from this repository in your Power BI reports, please make sure you follow Microsoft [terms of use](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/marketplace/marketplace-terms) and the ones shared by the publisher.

Q: Can I find in this repository older pbiviz files that are no longer available by Microsoft?

> A: Yes. You will find all versions of the visuals since January 2024 under **PBIVIZ with versions** subfolder that is under **All Visuals**,**Certified**, and **Uncertified** folders. In addition, if the visuals are no longer on AppSource, you will find their last version under the **Unlisted** [folder](https://github.com/DataChant/PowerBI-Visuals-AppSource/tree/main/Unlisted).

Q: What is the difference between the visual files in **PBIVIZ** and the ones in **PBIVIZ with versions** subfolder?
> A: The same visuals exist in both subfolders. However, in PBIVIZ subfolder, we store the latest version of each visual in a user-friendly filename. In PBIVIZ with versions, each visual may have multiple files with the versions in the filename suffix.

Q: What is the difference between **PBIVIZ** and **PBIVIZ with guid** subfolders?
> A: The same visuals exist in both subfolders but with different filenames. In PBIVIZ subfolder, we store the visuals in user-friendly filenames. In PBIVIZ with guid, we store the visuals with their official visual GUIDs as they are found in Power BI reports and extracted project files. The GUIDs will help you match visuals in your reports with the ones in this repository.

Q: How can I learn more about custom visuals that I found in this repository? 

> A: You can learn more about all the custom visuals on AppSource and contact the publishers. For a broader analysis of all custom visuals, you can install our Custom Visuals Exploration Tool [here](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/power-bi/datachant-5311696.powerbi_customvisuals?tab=Overview).
